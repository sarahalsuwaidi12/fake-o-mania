                        <h3 class="my-4" style="text-align: justify;">Schools should not reopen unless key measures are in place to stop the spread of coronavirus, unions have warned.</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                          The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is urging ministers to work closely with unions to agree a way forward.

                          There was speculation schools may return in England from 1 June, but it was ruled out in Scotland and Wales.
                          
                          England's Department for Education said it would follow scientific advice about the "right time" to reopen schools.
                          
                          Schools across the UK closed in the last week of March as part of the lockdown measures to prevent the virus spreading.
                          
                          Prime Minister Boris Johnson will give details on Sunday of his "roadmap" to get the UK out of lockdown.
                          
                          Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said Mr Johnson's plans for easing the measures in England would be "very much in line" with "modest" changes already outlined in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
                          
                          Speaking to Fake-O-mania Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford added: "We're not going to be reopening schools in Wales in the next three weeks, or indeed in June."
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is the UK's test, track and trace strategy? </li>
                                <li>Teachers warn of early school return 'virus spike'</li>
                                <li>Welsh schools not reopening on 1 June</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            Unions, including the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) and the National Education Union (NEU), have called for "clear, scientific published evidence" that schools are safe to re-open.

In a joint statement sent to UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, they said there should be no increase in pupil numbers until a national test, track and trace scheme has been fully rolled out.

The government's three-pronged coronavirus strategy is being rolled out in various stages, with the NHS contact-tracing smartphone app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight before a UK-wide expansion.

They have called for extra resources for deep cleaning, personal protective equipment (PPE) and local powers to close schools if there is an outbreak of the virus in a particular area.
