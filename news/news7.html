                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                          But his speeches through the course of the war galvanised and heartened those fighting and enduring the dangers and privations of World War II.

                          "Winston Churchill's words inspired a nation," says the victorious prime minister's great grandson.
                          
                          "What we want to do is to help inspire a new generation in their struggle against Covid."
                          
                          As the country - and much of Europe - marks the 75th anniversary of VE Day in the most unusual of circumstances, Randolph Churchill is launching a competition for young people to try their hand at a rousing speech.
                          
                          The key to writing a galvanising address is to "never give in", he told Fake-O-mania Breakfast, adding: "They shouldn't be shy, they just crack on and do it, try their best, and if they don't succeed the first time, they should try again and again and again."
                          
                          And he says it is the "spirit" of the nation that we "always get there in the end".
                            <ul>
                                <li>UK falls silent to mark VE Day 75 years on</li>
                                <li>What is VE Day?</li>
                                <li>VE Day: 'Do not despair, do not yield'</li>
                            </ul>
                            A glance at some of Churchill's most memorable appearances at the dispatch box provide that extra inspiration.

Here are some examples of the wartime PM's speeches to Parliament, shared by the Commons' Hansard team: 
                            <h3>'Strong horses'</h3>
                            When Churchill gave this speech in the Commons, he was yet to become prime minister.

But during a debate on Britain's disastrous campaign in Norway - leading to Neville Chamberlain's ousting from No 10 - Churchill spoke optimistically of the Navy being strengthened by Norway's merchant fleet.

Two days later, he would become PM and form his coalition government.

  "Let me say that I am not advocating controversy... On the contrary, I say, let pre-war feuds die; let personal quarrels be forgotten, and let us keep our hatreds for the common enemy.

  "Let party interest be ignored, let all our energies be harnessed, let the whole ability and forces of the nation be hurled into the struggle, and let all the strong horses be pulling on the collar."
